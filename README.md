### Problem Statement
The process of applying reported device codes to medical device complaints received from the field is highly manual and time-consuming. 
This leads to inefficiencies, increased chances of human error, and delays in addressing complaints, which can ultimately impact patient safety and regulatory compliance.

Challenges:

High Volume of Complaints: The influx of complaints can overwhelm staff, leading to backlogs.

Manual Coding Errors: Human errors in coding can lead to incorrect device codes being applied, affecting data accuracy and regulatory reporting.

Inconsistent Coding Practices: Variability in how different staff members apply codes can lead to inconsistencies and confusion.

Time Consumption: The manual process is resource-intensive, diverting staff from more critical tasks.

### Goals
Develop an automated solution that streamlines the coding process for medical device complaints, ensuring timely, accurate, and consistent application of device codes.
